description: "Use for frontend interface work of any kind: designing, redesigning, critiquing, auditing, polishing or improving a site, app, dashboard or component."
when_to_use: "Use when the user wants to design, redesign, shape, critique, audit, polish, clarify, distill, harden, optimize, adapt, animate, colorize, extract, or otherwise improve a frontend interface. Covers websites, landing pages, dashboards, product UI, app shells, components, forms, settings, onboarding, and empty states. Handles UX review, visual hierarchy, information architecture, cognitive load, accessibility, performance, responsive behavior, theming, anti-patterns, typography, fonts, spacing, layout, alignment, color, motion, micro-interactions, UX copy, error states, edge cases, i18n, and reusable design systems or tokens. Also use for bland designs that need to become bolder or more delightful, loud designs that should become quieter, live browser iteration on UI elements, or ambitious visual effects that should feel technically extraordinary. Not for backend-only or non-UI tasks."

This skill gives you the tools and permission to create design that earns to be called out-of-distribution craft: Whereas before, your design work would have been safe, timid and measured, you now approach every design task as a award-winning design director with impeccable understanding for what makes exceptional design work: production-grade code, peak creativity, a clear POV, deep understanding of the needs of the client and users, and exceptional craft.

Core principles:
- Go all out. No hedging, no shortcuts. The deliverable must be complete (except assets the user must provide).
- Dream big and bold. Distinct, beautiful, outstanding and highly inspiring work.
- Verify in bounded passes, not a loop, and the ceiling covers the whole cycle: screenshots, defect scans, micro-edits, and rebuilds alike. Build fully, inspect once with a batched round (desktop and mobile together), fix everything it shows in one batch, confirm with at most one more round, and stop polishing. Open-ended self-QA burns the user's money doing worse what the finish handoffs do better.

## Setup

1. Run `node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/context.mjs` once per session (if the runtime shows this skill's loaded base directory, run `node <skill-base-dir>/scripts/context.mjs`; keep cwd at the user's project). Pass a named source file or route as `--target <path>`. It loads PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, the matching surface brief, and native-platform guidance when applicable; follow its directives and do not rerun it.
2. Before acting, load the one playbook that owns the request: the Commands table's reference for an explicit or clearly implied sub-command, or [reference/new-work.md](reference/new-work.md) for a new surface or replacement visual world. Then inspect the target and at least one representative source of incumbent visual truth (tokens, theme, CSS, component, or asset) before editing.
3. After analysis and direction are resolved, load [reference/craft-floor.md](reference/craft-floor.md) immediately before editing UI. It carries the quality floor, the absolute bans, and the reflexes no detector catches. Do not load it for planning-only work.

## How to design

- **The brief wins.** Honor pinned aesthetics, eras, materials, fonts, and palettes even when they conflict with a saturated-pattern warning. Redirecting a clear brief toward your taste is failure.
- **Refinement preserves; redesign replaces.** Refinement keeps the incumbent identity, behavior, copy, and everything outside scope. Ask before replacing factual copy or adding claims. Redesign keeps product truth, content, function, native affordances, and constraints, but treats the old look as evidence and anti-reference; choose a replacement world in new-work and replace DESIGN.md. Never split the difference into polish on the discarded look.
- **Visual authority is evidence, not a filename.** Missing DESIGN.md alone does not make a project greenfield; new-work decides whether to preserve, expand, or replace the incumbent world.

## Modes

The mode names what the visitor's success looks like on this surface.

- **Persuade:** the visitor decides and acts; design is the product. Landing pages, marketing, campaigns, pricing. Earn attention and action. Ship real imagery when the brief needs it; follow the committed world, not category habit.
- **Operate:** the visitor completes a task. App UI, dashboards, editors, admin, settings, tools. Scanability, consistency, native expectations, and the real usage scene outrank expression. Brand lives in precise details.
- **Read:** the visitor understands something. Docs, articles, guides, help, changelogs. Structure for comprehension, then make the reading experience worth staying in.
- **Experience:** the visitor is inside the work itself. Portfolios, galleries, showcases. Let the artifact lead from the first viewport; the interface recedes.

Choose the mode from the requested surface, not the product, and persist it only in that surface brief. A tool's landing page is still Persuade; a fashion house's documentation is still Read; a docs index is Read, not Persuade. See [new-work.md](reference/new-work.md) for new surfaces and [operate.md](reference/operate.md) for deeper Operate/Read guidance.

Routing:

- **No argument:** read [routing.md](reference/routing.md) and present its context-aware menu; never auto-run a command.
- **Explicit or clearly implied command:** load its reference (native variant on native platforms) and follow it. Ask once if two commands fit.
- **Otherwise:** treat the request as general design work. Missing PRODUCT.md routes a new surface or replacement world through init, then new-work; a narrow refinement of existing code proceeds on the incumbent implementation as context.mjs directs, offering init afterward rather than blocking on it.
- `teach` aliases `init`. `craft` is a deprecated alias for ordinary new-work and adds nothing. `shape` owns task discovery, then enters new-work only for visual-world and surface-concept decisions.

After init writes PRODUCT.md, resume without rerunning `context.mjs`; init loads the native platform reference itself when the platform it recorded is `ios`, `android`, or `adaptive`.

**Pin / Unpin:** `node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/pin.mjs <pin|unpin> <command>` creates or removes a standalone `$<command>` shortcut. Report the script's result concisely; relay stderr verbatim on error.

**Hooks:** `$impeccable hooks <on|off|status|ignore-rule|ignore-file|ignore-value|reset>` manages the design detector hook for this project (auto-runs the detector after UI file edits and surfaces findings). Load [reference/hooks.md](reference/hooks.md) when the user invokes it with any argument.

**Doctor:** `$impeccable doctor` reports and repairs drift between this project's Impeccable artifacts (PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md and its sidecar, config, surface briefs, the hook) and what this version reads. Load [reference/doctor.md](reference/doctor.md) when the user invokes it, or when they ask what is out of date, stale, or needs refreshing. A `CONTEXT_STALE` directive in Setup's output is the cheap subset of the same report; act on it there per its own instructions rather than running doctor unasked.

**Never repair drift as a side effect of a design task.** A `CONTEXT_STALE` finding is reported, not acted on, unless the user asks. The one exception is a finding marked `auto`, which the next write to that file performs anyway.

## Where the concrete design material actually is

**This package is the process. It is not the menu, and it carries no route to one.** Verified by
grep across the whole package on 2026-08-09: zero references to `~/.agents/design/`, to
`LIBRARIES.md`, or to `~/.agents/DESIGN.md`. Three independent blind probes reached this skill and
had to be rescued by the shared contract, and the third one measured the counterfactual exactly —
a session that enters through this skill and never reads `AGENTS.md` gets a quality floor and a
Refuse list with **no typeface pool, no palette table, no animation package comparison, and no
mechanical pre-ship matrix**, and fills each gap from training memory. That reliably produces the
defaults the floor below tells you to avoid.

So before Setup, open the router and pick the leaf your decision needs:

**`~/.agents/design/LIBRARIES.md`** — a pointer table, not an enumeration. Read it there rather
than working from any list, including this one; leaves are added over time and a copied list goes
stale. The ones a landing, product or marketing surface reaches for most:

| You are deciding | Leaf |
|---|---|
| Which typeface, and whether a serif is even available to you | `design/type/families.md` |
| Palette construction, contrast arithmetic, type scale, grid | `design/fundamentals.md` |
| Which animation package, and whether motion is warranted at all | `design/animation/libraries.md`, with `design/animation/forbidden.md` |
| Whether a marketing or portfolio page is finished | `design/preflight.md` — mechanical, ~60 boxes |
| Whether a **dashboard** is finished | `design/dashboards.md` — `preflight.md` explicitly does not cover this medium |
| Touch targets, safe areas, mobile type, gesture conflicts | `design/mobile.md` |
| Surface construction: nested enclosures, button architecture, island nav | `design/craft/high-end.md` |
| Whether a committed visual world already exists | `design/languages/registry.md` — check before inventing another |

**`~/.agents/DESIGN.md`** holds the universal rules and, in its *Precedence* section, states where
this package outranks it and where it does not. Read that section before resolving a conflict by
instinct: they genuinely disagree in places, and the resolution is not uniform in either
direction.

**Two corrections to this package's own text**, both measured rather than inferred:

- Its craft reference opens by saying a design hook already enforces the mechanical checks as you
  edit, so you should act on its findings instead of re-auditing each rule. **There is no design
  hook on any surface.** The installed hooks are the continue, security and task-state
  dispatchers; none inspects design. That condition never fires, so every check in that file is
  yours to run by hand.
- Its commands table lives only in the canonical package. The thin projection a product renders
  carries the description and `when_to_use` and no sub-command inventory, so an agent that meets
  this skill through a product listing cannot see that the sub-commands exist. Open the canonical
  `SKILL.md` for the full table.

If `~/.agents` does not exist in this environment — a container, a fresh machine — the same
material is in the private `pyrgos-ai/doug-harness` repository under `.agents/design/`. Read it in
place; never vendor a copy into the project you are working in.
